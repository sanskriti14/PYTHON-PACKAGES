INTRODUCTION:
TensorFlow works like a computational library for writing new algorithms that involve a large number of tensor operations, 
since neural networks can be easily expressed as computational graphs they can be implemented using TensorFlow as a series of 
operations on Tensors. Plus, tensors are N-dimensional matrices which represent your data.

PROGRAM:

import tensorflow as tf

x1 = tf.constant([1,2,3,4])
x2 = tf.constant([5,6,7,8])

result = tf.multiply(x1, x2)

sess = tf.Session()

print(sess.run(result))

sess.close()
