Numpy VS SciPy

Numpy:
Numpy is written in C and use for mathematical or numeric calculation.
It is faster than other Python Libraries
Numpy is the most useful library for Data Science to perform basic calculations.
Numpy contains nothing but array data type which performs the most basic operation like sorting, shaping, indexing, etc.

SciPy:
SciPy is built in top of the NumPy
SciPy is a fully-featured version of Linear Algebra while Numpy contains only a few features.
Most new Data Science features are available in Scipy rather than Numpy.


Cubic Root Function:
Cubic Root function finds the cube root of values.

Syntax:
      scipy.special.cbrt(x)

PROGRAM:

      from scipy.special import cbrt
      cb = cbrt([27, 64])
      print(cb)

Output: array([3., 4.])
